## üîß CURRENT STATUS

**No tasks in progress** - Project is complete and production-ready!

## üéØ OPTIONAL FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

These are **optional improvements** - the driver is fully functional without them.

### Testing Infrastructure (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Create pytest unit test suite
  - [ ] tests/test_protocol.py - Protocol constants
  - [ ] tests/test_packet.py - Packet building/parsing
  - [ ] tests/test_connection.py - Connection management
  - [ ] tests/test_driver.py - Driver operations
- [ ] Create mock PLC for testing without hardware
- [ ] Set up pytest fixtures and test coverage reporting
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)

### Protocol Research (Investigation Needed)
- [ ] **Investigate minimum read length requirements in detail**
  - [ ] Document exact behavior when reading near configured memory boundaries
  - [ ] Test with various configured memory sizes (64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 registers)
  - [ ] Determine if minimum read padding affects boundary conditions
  - [ ] Example: Reading 61-65 registers with only 64 configured caused issues
  - [ ] Workaround: Increase configured memory (e.g., to 1024) allows reading all 65
  - [ ] Research: Does PLC require padding to minimum read lengths? (4 words, 8 bytes, 64 bits)
  - [ ] Document findings in docs/protocol.md
  - [ ] Update driver documentation with memory configuration recommendations

### Advanced Features (Enhancement)
- [ ] Implement advanced forensic module (src/forensic.py)
  - [ ] Full memory dump with all memory types
  - [ ] Snapshot comparison (diff two dumps)
  - [ ] Continuous monitoring daemon
  - [ ] Multiple export formats (JSON, CSV, binary, SQL)
- [ ] Add 1-based addressing helper methods (user convenience)
  - [ ] read_register_ui(1) ‚Üí reads %R1 (subtracts 1 internally)
  - [ ] Configuration flag to choose addressing mode
- [ ] Symbolic tag addressing support
  - [ ] See docs/symbolic_addressing.md for research plan
  - [ ] Requires packet capture from Kepware
  - [ ] Reverse engineer symbolic read protocol

### Code Quality (Polish)
- [ ] Run pylint on all source files
- [ ] Run mypy type checking
- [ ] Run black code formatting
- [ ] Generate API documentation (Sphinx/mkdocs)
- [ ] Create architecture diagram
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization

### Documentation (Polish)
- [ ] Create docs/troubleshooting.md - Common issues and solutions
- [ ] Create docs/api_reference.md - Generated from docstrings
- [ ] Add video tutorial or animated GIFs
- [ ] Write blog post about protocol discoveries

### Advanced Features (Low Priority)
- [ ] Web dashboard for PLC monitoring
- [ ] Multi-PLC support (concurrent connections)
- [ ] Redundancy support (dual-CPU configurations)
- [ ] Data logging daemon with database storage
- [ ] Alerting system for value changes
- [ ] Wireshark packet export capability

### Write Operations (‚ö†Ô∏è NOT RECOMMENDED)
- [ ] **DO NOT IMPLEMENT** unless absolutely necessary
- [ ] If required, implement with extensive safety features:
  - [ ] Confirmation prompts for EVERY write
  - [ ] Comprehensive logging (who, what, when)
  - [ ] Dry-run mode (test without executing)
  - [ ] Rollback capability if possible
  - [ ] Rate limiting
  - [ ] Privilege level checking
  - [ ] Emergency stop/disconnect

**Warning**: Write operations can cause physical damage to equipment or endanger workers. Only implement if there is a compelling use case AND comprehensive safety measures.

## üéì Key Lessons Learned

1. **Academic papers are invaluable but incomplete** - DFRWS paper provided foundation, but real hardware testing revealed critical details
2. **Multi-packet responses are tricky** - TCP streaming behavior requires careful recv() handling
3. **Hardware configuration matters** - Slot number, firmware version, installed modules all affect behavior
4. **RX3i differs from Series 90-30** - Higher minimum lengths required for discrete I/O
5. **Documentation is critical** - Future implementers will appreciate detailed findings

## üîí Security Notes

- ‚úÖ **Read-Only Design** - No write operations implemented
- ‚úÖ **Non-Invasive** - Cannot modify PLC program or data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Authentication** - GE-SRTP has minimal security
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use on isolated networks only**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Legal compliance required** - Ensure authorization before accessing PLCs
