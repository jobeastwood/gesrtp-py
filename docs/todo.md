## üîß CURRENT STATUS

**v1.1.0**: Production ready for traditional addressing ‚úÖ

**Active Research** (October 2025):
- üî¨ Symbolic tag addressing investigation via KEPServerEX packet analysis
- üî¨ Additional data types research (INT, DINT, REAL, STRING, etc.)
- üî¨ Write operations protocol understanding (‚ö†Ô∏è with extreme safety focus)

---

## üî¨ ACTIVE RESEARCH GOALS

**Environment**: Windows 10/11 with KEPServerEX and Wireshark
**Approach**: Trial and error / reverse engineering (limited GE-SRTP documentation)

### Research Goal #1: Symbolic Tag Addressing

**Status**: üî¨ Active Investigation
**Priority**: High (major usability improvement)

- [ ] Capture KEPServerEX traffic reading symbolic tags
- [ ] Analyze GE-SRTP packets for tag name protocol
- [ ] Identify service codes for symbolic addressing
- [ ] Determine if symbol table download is used
- [ ] Implement `read_tag("TagName")` functionality
- [ ] Test with various tag types (INT, BOOL, REAL, etc.)

**Documentation**: See `docs/symbolic_addressing.md` for detailed investigation plan

### Research Goal #2: Additional Data Types

**Status**: üî¨ Planned Research
**Priority**: Medium (enhanced data type support)

**Current Support**: 16-bit words, bits, bytes
**Target Support**:

| Data Type | Size | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| BOOL/BIT | 1 bit | ‚úÖ Working |
| BYTE | 8 bits | ‚úÖ Working |
| WORD | 16 bits | ‚ö†Ô∏è As register |
| INT | 16 bits | üî¨ Research |
| UINT | 16 bits | üî¨ Research |
| DWORD | 32 bits | üî¨ Research |
| DINT | 32 bits | üî¨ Research |
| UDINT | 32 bits | üî¨ Research |
| REAL | 32 bits | üî¨ Research (IEEE 754 float) |
| LREAL | 64 bits | üî¨ Research (IEEE 754 double) |
| STRING | Variable | üî¨ Research |
| ENUM | Variable | üî¨ Research |

**Investigation Steps**:
- [ ] Create PLC program with various data types
- [ ] Capture KEPServerEX reading each data type
- [ ] Identify service codes and encoding for each type
- [ ] Implement type-specific read functions
- [ ] Add proper byte-order handling (little-endian)
- [ ] Test decoding (especially REAL/LREAL float formats)

**Documentation**: See `docs/wireshark.md` section on data type research

### Research Goal #3: Write Operations

**Status**: üî¨ Research Only (‚ö†Ô∏è NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION YET)
**Priority**: Low (safety-critical, requires extensive research)

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL WARNING**: Write operations are EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
- Can damage physical equipment ($$$$$ repairs)
- Can cause worker injury or death
- Can disrupt critical processes
- Must implement extensive safety measures

**Investigation Approach**:
- [ ] Capture KEPServerEX write operations with Wireshark
- [ ] Identify write service codes (0x07? 0x08? Other?)
- [ ] Understand payload structure for writes
- [ ] Document address encoding for writes
- [ ] Research verification/acknowledgment mechanism

**Safety Requirements BEFORE Implementation**:
- [ ] Dry-run mode (validate but don't execute)
- [ ] Explicit confirmation for EVERY write
- [ ] Comprehensive logging (who, what, when, where)
- [ ] Rollback capability (if possible)
- [ ] Rate limiting to prevent rapid writes
- [ ] Emergency disconnect mechanism
- [ ] Privilege/permission system
- [ ] Testing on non-critical PLCs only

**DO NOT IMPLEMENT** until protocol fully understood AND all safety measures designed!

**Documentation**: See `docs/wireshark.md` section on write operations research

  - [ ] Determine if minimum read padding affects boundary conditions
  - [ ] Example: Reading 61-65 registers with only 64 configured caused issues
  - [ ] Workaround: Increase configured memory (e.g., to 1024) allows reading all 65
  - [ ] Research: Does PLC require padding to minimum read lengths? (4 words, 8 bytes, 64 bits)
  - [ ] Document findings in docs/protocol.md

- [ ] Add 1-based addressing helper methods (user convenience)
  - [ ] read_register_ui(1) ‚Üí reads %R1 (subtracts 1 internally)
  - [ ] Configuration flag to choose addressing mode
- [ ] Symbolic tag addressing support
  - [ ] See docs/symbolic_addressing.md for research plan
  - [ ] Requires packet capture from Kepware
  - [ ] Reverse engineer symbolic read protocol

- [ ] Redundancy support (dual-CPU configurations)
- [ ] Data logging daemon with database storage
- [ ] Alerting system for value changes
- [ ] Wireshark packet export capability

### Write Operations (‚ö†Ô∏è NOT RECOMMENDED)
- [ ] **DO NOT IMPLEMENT** unless absolutely necessary
- [ ] If required, implement with extensive safety features:
  - [ ] Confirmation prompts for EVERY write
  - [ ] Comprehensive logging (who, what, when)
  - [ ] Dry-run mode (test without executing)
  - [ ] Rollback capability if possible
  - [ ] Rate limiting

2. **Multi-packet responses are tricky** - TCP streaming behavior requires careful recv() handling
3. **Hardware configuration matters** - Slot number, firmware version, installed modules all affect behavior
4. **RX3i differs from Series 90-30** - Higher minimum lengths required for discrete I/O
5. **Documentation is critical** - Future implementers will appreciate detailed findings

## üîí Security Notes

- ‚úÖ **Read-Only Design** - No write operations implemented
- ‚úÖ **Non-Invasive** - Cannot modify PLC program or data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Authentication** - GE-SRTP has minimal security
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use on isolated networks only**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Legal compliance required** - Ensure authorization before accessing PLCs
