# Discovery #1: All-Zeros Initialization Sequence

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: ✅ SOLVED

## The Problem

Initial implementation had non-zero bytes in the initialization packet, causing timeouts:
```python
# WRONG - Initial attempt
INIT_PACKET_1 = bytes([
    0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,  # Byte 0 = 0x01 ❌
    0x0f, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,  # Byte 8 = 0x0f ❌
    # ... rest zeros
])
```

**Symptom**:
```
2025-10-15 22:28:44 - TCP connection established ✓
2025-10-15 22:28:44 - Sending initialization packet 1...
2025-10-15 22:28:49 - Timeout receiving response ❌
```

## The Source: DFRWS 2017 Paper

### Key Quote (Page 3):
> "Based on our understanding of the protocol, the initialize bit streams of **all zeros** were exchanged between the master device (HMI) and the PLC slave to start communication between the devices."

## The Solution

Initialization must be exactly **56 bytes of all zeros**:

```python
# CORRECT
INIT_PACKET_1 = bytes(56)  # All zeros
```

**Result**: PLC responds with byte[0] = 0x01, connection ready!

## Implementation

**File**: `src/protocol.py`
```python
# Initialization packets (2-packet handshake)
INIT_PACKET_1 = bytes(56)  # All zeros - per DFRWS paper
INIT_PACKET_2 = bytes(56)  # All zeros - second handshake
```

**File**: `src/connection.py`
```python
def _initialize(self):
    """Perform two-packet initialization handshake."""
    # Send first init packet
    self.sock.send(protocol.INIT_PACKET_1)
    response1 = self._receive_data(56)
    if response1[0] != 0x01:
        raise exceptions.InitializationError("Init packet 1 failed")

    # Send second init packet
    self.sock.send(protocol.INIT_PACKET_2)
    response2 = self._receive_data(56)
    # Connection ready!
```

## Verification

Our **packet structure is 100% correct** according to DFRWS paper (Table 1, Page 4):
- ✅ 56 bytes total
- ✅ Byte 0: Type (0x02 for request)
- ✅ Byte 2 & 30: Sequence number
- ✅ Byte 31: Message type (0xc0)
- ✅ Bytes 32-35: Mailbox source (0x00 00 00 00)
- ✅ Bytes 36-39: Mailbox destination (0x10 0e 00 00)
- ✅ Byte 42: Service request code
- ✅ Byte 43: Segment selector
- ✅ Bytes 44-45: Data offset (little-endian)
- ✅ Bytes 46-47: Data length (little-endian)

The ONLY issue was the initialization sequence pattern.

## Impact

**Critical**: Without correct initialization, PLC never responds to any requests.

# Discovery #2: Multi-Packet TCP Response Protocol

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: ✅ SOLVED - Driver Working!

## The Problem

After fixing initialization, read operations were failing with empty payloads:
- TCP connection: ✓ Working
- Initialization: ✓ Working
- Register reads: ✗ PLC returns ACK but no data

```
Request:  service=0x04, selector=0x08, offset=1, length=1
Response: msg_type=0xD4 (ACK), payload_len=0 ❌
Error:    IndexError - list index out of range
```

## The Investigation

### Finding 1: Minimum Data Length Threshold

Testing different `data_length` values revealed:

| data_length | Response Type | Payload Length |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1           | 0xD4 (ACK)    | 0 bytes        |
| 2           | 0xD4 (ACK)    | 0 bytes        |
| 3           | 0xD4 (ACK)    | 0 bytes        |
| **4**       | **0x94**      | **8 bytes** ✓  |
| 5           | 0x94          | 10 bytes ✓     |
| 10          | 0x94          | 20 bytes ✓     |

**Conclusion**: PLC requires **minimum data_length of 4 words (8 bytes)** for register reads.

### Finding 2: New Message Type 0x94

When data IS returned, response uses message type **0x94** instead of 0xD4:
- **0xD4** = ACK (no payload)
- **0x94** = ACK_WITH_DATA (payload follows)
- **0xD1** = ERROR/NACK

**This was NOT documented in the DFRWS paper!**

### Finding 3: Multi-Packet TCP Responses (CRITICAL!)

The breakthrough came from testing with chunked `recv()`:

```python
# First recv() call
chunk1 = sock.recv(1024)
print(f'Chunk 1: {len(chunk1)} bytes')  # Output: 56 bytes (header only!)

# Second recv() call
chunk2 = sock.recv(1024)
print(f'Chunk 2: {len(chunk2)} bytes')  # Output: 8 bytes (payload!)
```

**The PLC sends responses in TWO separate TCP packets:**
1. **Packet 1**: 56-byte header
2. **Packet 2**: Payload data (8, 10, 20 bytes depending on request)

### Finding 4: Payload Length Indicator

**Byte 4** of the response header contains the payload length:

```
Response header byte 4: 0x08  →  Expect 8 bytes of payload
Response header byte 4: 0x0A  →  Expect 10 bytes of payload
Response header byte 4: 0x14  →  Expect 20 bytes of payload
Response header byte 4: 0x00  →  No payload
```

**This field is NOT documented in DFRWS paper's Table 4 (Response Packet Structure).**

## The Solution

### 1. Added New Protocol Constant

**File**: `src/protocol.py`
```python
class MessageType(IntEnum):
    REQUEST = 0xC0
    ACK = 0xD4
    ACK_WITH_DATA = 0x94  # NEW: Response with data payload
    ERROR = 0xD1
```

### 2. Updated Packet Parser

**File**: `src/packet.py`
```python
# Accept both ACK (0xD4) and ACK_WITH_DATA (0x94) as successful responses
if packet.message_type not in (protocol.MessageType.ACK, protocol.MessageType.ACK_WITH_DATA):
    logger.warning(f"Unexpected message type: 0x{packet.message_type:02X}")
```

### 3. Fixed Multi-Packet Reception

**File**: `src/connection.py`
```python
def _receive_data(self, max_bytes: int) -> bytes:
    """Receive data from PLC, handling multi-packet responses."""
    # First, receive the 56-byte header
    header = self.sock.recv(56)

    # Check byte 4 for payload length indicator
    payload_length = header[4]

    if payload_length > 0:
        # Receive the payload in a second packet
        payload = self.sock.recv(payload_length)

        # Combine header and payload
        return header + payload
    else:
        # No payload, just return header
        return header
```

### 4. Enforced Minimum Data Length

**File**: `src/driver.py`
```python
def read_register(self, address: int, count: int = 1):
    """Read register memory (%R)."""
    # PLC requires minimum data_length of 4 words (8 bytes)
    # Request at least 4, but return only what was asked for
    request_length = max(count, 4)

    response = self._send_request_and_receive(
        service_code=protocol.ServiceCode.READ_SYSTEM_MEMORY,
        segment_selector=protocol.SegmentSelector.REGISTERS_WORD,
        data_offset=address,
        data_length=request_length
    )

    values = response.extract_word_values()

    # Return only the requested number of values
    return values[:count]
```

## Test Results

### Successful Operations
```python
plc.read_register(1)              # Returns: 16544 ✓
plc.read_register(1, count=5)     # Returns: [16544, 0, 16160, 18023, 16866] ✓
plc.read_register(100)            # Returns: 0 ✓
```

### Full Test Suite
```
✓ TCP connection established
✓ Initialization handshake complete
✓ Single register read works
✓ Batch register read works
✓ PLC status query works
✓ Context manager works
✓ ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

## Why This Matters

### 1. Not in Academic Literature
The DFRWS 2017 paper does NOT mention:
- The 0x94 message type
- The multi-packet response behavior
- The minimum data_length requirement
- Byte 4 as payload length indicator

### 2. Not in Reference Implementations
Reference implementations likely work around this by:
- Always requesting larger blocks
- Using different socket configurations that buffer both packets

### 3. Critical for Protocol Implementation
Without understanding multi-packet responses:
- Single `recv()` call only gets header
- Payload appears "missing"
- Driver appears broken despite correct packet structure

### 4. TCP Streaming Behavior
This is a **TCP application protocol design choice** by GE:
- They intentionally split header and payload into separate `send()` calls
- Standard TCP behavior: receiver must know to call `recv()` multiple times
- Byte 4 serves as the "length prefix" for the payload

## Impact

**Critical**: This discovery made the driver functional. Without it, NO data could be read from the PLC.

# Discovery #3: CPU Slot-Specific Addressing

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: ✅ SOLVED

## The Problem

After fixing multi-packet handling, PLC was still returning empty payloads:
- Service code in response: 0x00 (not 0x04 that was sent)
- Segment selector in response: 0x00 (not 0x08 that was sent)
- Data length: 0

This indicated requests were being acknowledged but not processed properly.

## Root Cause

**The CPU is installed in slot 2, not slot 1.** The mailbox destination address must specify the correct slot number to route the request to the CPU.

## Mailbox Addressing Format

The mailbox destination address (bytes 36-39) format is:
```
Byte 36: Rack/Bus ID multiplied by slot number (slot * 0x10)
Byte 37: Port/Channel (typically 0x0E)
Byte 38: Reserved (0x00)
Byte 39: Reserved (0x00)
```

### Slot-Specific Addresses
- **Slot 1** (default): `0x10 0x0E 0x00 0x00`
- **Slot 2**: `0x20 0x0E 0x00 0x00` ← This PLC
- **Slot 3**: `0x30 0x0E 0x00 0x00`
- **Slot N**: `0x{N*0x10} 0x0E 0x00 0x00`

**Formula**: First byte = `slot * 0x10`

## The Solution

### 1. Added Slot Configuration Function

**File**: `src/protocol.py`
```python
def get_mailbox_destination(slot: int = 1) -> bytes:
    """
    Generate mailbox destination address for a specific PLC slot.

    Args:
        slot: CPU slot number (typically 1-8)

    Returns:
        4-byte mailbox destination address
    """
    return bytes([slot * 0x10, 0x0E, 0x00, 0x00])
```

### 2. Updated Packet Builder

**File**: `src/packet.py`
```python
def build_request(
    sequence_number: int,
    service_code: int,
    segment_selector: int = 0,
    data_offset: int = 0,
    data_length: int = 0,
    payload: bytes = b'',
    slot: int = 1  # NEW PARAMETER
) -> bytes:
    # ... packet building code ...

    # Bytes 36-39: Mailbox destination (slot-specific)
    packet[36:40] = protocol.get_mailbox_destination(slot)

    # ... rest of packet ...
```

### 3. Updated Driver Class

**File**: `src/driver.py`
```python
def __init__(
    self,
    host: str,
    port: int = protocol.DEFAULT_PORT,
    timeout: int = protocol.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT,
    slot: int = 1  # NEW PARAMETER
):
    self.slot = slot
    logger.info(f"Initialized GE-SRTP driver for {host}:{port} (CPU slot {slot})")

def _send_request_and_receive(self, ...):
    request = SRTPPacket.build_request(
        sequence_number=seq,
        service_code=service_code,
        segment_selector=segment_selector,
        data_offset=data_offset,
        data_length=data_length,
        slot=self.slot  # PASS SLOT
    )
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix (Slot 1 - WRONG)
```
Built request packet: seq=0, service=0x04, selector=0x08, offset=1, length=1
Mailbox destination: 0x10 0x0E 0x00 0x00  ❌
Response: msg_type=0xD4 (ACK), payload_len=0
Result: Empty payload, IndexError
```

### After Fix (Slot 2 - CORRECT)
```
Built request packet: seq=0, service=0x04, selector=0x08, offset=1, length=4
Mailbox destination: 0x20 0x0E 0x00 0x00  ✅
Response: msg_type=0x94 (ACK_WITH_DATA), payload_len=8
Result: SUCCESS! Read %R1 = 16544
```

## Usage

```python
# Correct usage for this PLC (CPU in slot 2)
plc = GE_SRTP_Driver('172.16.12.127', slot=2)
plc.connect()
value = plc.read_register(1)
# Output: 16544

# Default behavior (if slot not specified, defaults to slot 1)
plc = GE_SRTP_Driver('172.16.12.127')  # Will use slot 1
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Slot Configuration is Critical**: Mailbox destination must match physical slot where CPU is installed

2. **Symptom of Wrong Slot**: PLC responds with ACK but empty payload, response header shows service code 0x00

3. **Not Documented in DFRWS Paper**: Research paper does not mention slot addressing requirements

4. **Always Ask About Hardware**: When troubleshooting PLCs, always ask:
   - What slot is the CPU in?
   - What is the rack configuration?
   - Are there multiple CPUs?

## Impact

**Critical**: Without correct slot addressing, no data can be read from PLC even though connection and initialization work.

# Discovery #4: 0-Based vs 1-Based Addressing Scheme

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: ✅ CLARIFIED

## The Issue

Confusion about register numbering:
- PLC programming software displays registers as %R1, %R2, %R100, etc.
- Protocol uses addresses 0, 1, 99, etc.
- **Off-by-one errors** are common!

## The Mapping

The GE-SRTP protocol uses **0-based addressing** at the protocol level, while PLC programming software displays registers using **1-based addressing** for user convenience.

| PLC UI Display | Protocol Address | Driver Call |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| %R1            | 0                | `plc.read_register(0)` |
| %R2            | 1                | `plc.read_register(1)` |
| %R100          | 99               | `plc.read_register(99)` |
| %R1000         | 999              | `plc.read_register(999)` |

### Formula
```
Protocol Address = PLC Register Number - 1
```

Or inversely:
```
PLC Register Number = Protocol Address + 1
```

## Verification Against Real PLC

Tested with actual PLC at 172.16.12.127 (CPU in slot 2):

```python
plc = GE_SRTP_Driver('172.16.12.127', slot=2)
plc.connect()

# PLC UI shows: %R1 = 27546, %R2 = 18174

# Protocol addresses:
r1 = plc.read_register(0)  # Returns 27546 ✓ (%R1)
r2 = plc.read_register(1)  # Returns 18174 ✓ (%R2)
```

**Perfect match!** Protocol address 0 = %R1 on PLC display.

## Applies To All Memory Types

This addressing scheme applies to **all memory types**:

| Memory Type | PLC UI | Protocol Address |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| Registers   | %R1    | address=0        |
| Analog In   | %AI1   | address=0        |
| Analog Out  | %AQ1   | address=0        |
| Discrete In | %I1    | address=0        |
| Discrete Out| %Q1    | address=0        |
| Internals   | %M1    | address=0        |
| Temps       | %T1    | address=0        |

### Examples
```python
# Read %AI5 (Analog Input 5)
ai5 = plc.read_analog_input(4)  # address = 5 - 1 = 4

# Read %Q10 (Discrete Output 10)
q10 = plc.read_discrete_output(9)  # address = 10 - 1 = 9

# Read %M100 (Internal Memory 100)
m100 = plc.read_discrete_internal(99)  # address = 100 - 1 = 99
```

## Why Is It 0-Based?

Standard practice in industrial protocols:
1. **Protocol Efficiency**: 0-based addressing is more efficient at byte level
2. **C/Assembly Heritage**: Many industrial protocols originated in C/assembly where 0-based indexing is natural
3. **Memory Offsets**: 0-based addressing directly maps to memory offsets
4. **Industry Standard**: Modbus, EtherNet/IP, and many other protocols use 0-based addressing

The **+1 offset** is added by PLC programming software (HMI/SCADA) to make it more intuitive for operators.

## Reference Implementation Comparison

From DFRWS 2017 paper and reference implementations:
- All reference implementations use 0-based addressing
- Protocol specification defines addresses starting from 0
- GE's own documentation for SRTP shows 0-based addresses

## Current Implementation Decision

The driver uses **0-based addressing** (protocol native) because:
1. Matches the protocol specification exactly
2. Consistent with academic research and reference implementations
3. Avoids confusion about whether address translation is happening
4. Advanced users (target audience for forensic tool) will understand 0-based indexing

**Users must remember**: **Protocol Address = PLC Register Number - 1**

## Impact

**Important**: Users must be aware of 0-based addressing to avoid off-by-one errors. Documentation clearly explains this in README.md and examples.

# Discovery #5: RX3i-Specific Minimum Length Requirements

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: ✅ SOLVED - All Memory Types Working!

## The Problem

After implementing all previous fixes:
- ✅ Analog I/O (%AI, %AQ): Working perfectly
- ✗ Discrete I/O (%I, %Q, %M, %T, %S): Empty payloads

**Symptom**:
```
Request: selector=0x10 (DISCRETE_INPUTS_BYTE), length=4
Response: msg_type=0xD4 (ACK), payload_len=0 ← NO DATA!
```

## Initial Assumption

Initially assumed no discrete I/O hardware was installed (documented in `DISCRETE_MEMORY_FINDINGS.md`).

## Breakthrough

**User provided complete hardware configuration**: Discrete modules ARE installed!
- IC694MDL240 (Discrete Input, 16 Ch, 120 VAC) in Slot 8
- IC694MDL916 (Discrete Output, 16 Ch, 24 VDC) in Slot 9

**This meant the driver had a bug, not a hardware limitation!**

## Systematic Testing

### Phase 1: Byte Mode Discovery
**Test**: Try different byte counts

| count | Response | Payload |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1     | 0xD4 (ACK) | 0 bytes |
| 4     | 0xD4 (ACK) | 0 bytes |
| **8** | **0x94 (ACK_WITH_DATA)** | **8 bytes** ✓ |
| 16    | 0x94 | 16 bytes ✓ |

**Conclusion**: Byte mode requires **minimum 8 bytes** (not 4!)

### Phase 2: Bit Mode Discovery
**Test**: Try different bit counts

| count | Response | Payload |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1-32  | 0xD4 (ACK) | 0 bytes |
| **64** | **0x94 (ACK_WITH_DATA)** | **8 bytes** ✓ |
| 128   | 0x94 | 16 bytes ✓ |

**Conclusion**: Bit mode requires **minimum 64 bits** (not 32!)

## Complete Minimum Length Requirements

| Memory Type | Access Mode | Minimum Length | Unit |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|------|
| %R (Registers) | word | 4 | words |
| %AI (Analog Input) | word | 4 | words |
| %AQ (Analog Output) | word | 4 | words |
| %I (Discrete Input) | bit | 64 | bits |
| %I (Discrete Input) | byte | 8 | bytes |
| %Q (Discrete Output) | bit | 64 | bits |
| %Q (Discrete Output) | byte | 8 | bytes |
| %M (Internal Memory) | bit | 64 | bits |
| %M (Internal Memory) | byte | 8 | bytes |
| %T (Temporary Memory) | bit | 64 | bits |
| %T (Temporary Memory) | byte | 8 | bytes |
| %S (System Memory) | bit | 64 | bits |
| %S (System Memory) | byte | 8 | bytes |

## Comparison with Series 90-30

| Feature | Series 90-30 (DFRWS) | RX3i (Our Testing) |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Word operations minimum | 4 words | 4 words (same) |
| Byte operations minimum | 4 bytes (assumed) | **8 bytes** |
| Bit operations minimum | 32 bits (assumed) | **64 bits** |

**Conclusion**: RX3i requires **HIGHER minimums** for discrete I/O than Series 90-30!

## The Solution

### Updated Driver Implementation

**File**: `src/driver.py`

**Word Operations** (Unchanged):
```python
# Registers, Analog I/O
request_length = max(count, 4)  # 4 words minimum
```

**Byte Operations** (Updated):
```python
# Discrete I/O byte mode
request_length = max(count, 8)  # 8 bytes minimum - verified on RX3i
```

**Bit Operations** (Updated):
```python
# Discrete I/O bit mode
request_length = max(count, 64)  # 64 bits minimum - verified on RX3i
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix
```
✓ Analog I/O working (word mode, min 4 words)
✗ Discrete I/O byte mode - EMPTY
✗ Discrete I/O bit mode - EMPTY
```

### After Fix
```
✓ Analog I/O working
✓ Discrete I/O byte mode working!
✓ Discrete I/O bit mode working!
✓ Internal memory working!
✓ Temporary memory working!
✓ System memory working!
✓ ALL MEMORY TYPES WORKING!
```

### Verified Working
```python
# Discrete Inputs (%I) - Bit mode
bits = plc.read_discrete_input(0, count=8, mode='bit')
# Result: [False, True, False, False, False, True, True, True] ✓

# Discrete Inputs (%I) - Byte mode
bytes_data = plc.read_discrete_input(0, count=8, mode='byte')
# Result: [0xE2, 0x00, 0x6E, 0xF9, 0x00, 0x3E, 0x92, 0x54] ✓

# Discrete Outputs (%Q) - Bit mode
bits = plc.read_discrete_output(0, count=8, mode='bit')
# Result: [False, False, True, False, False, False, False, False] ✓

# Discrete Outputs (%Q) - Byte mode
bytes_data = plc.read_discrete_output(0, count=8, mode='byte')
# Result: [0x04, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00] ✓
```

## Why This Matters

### For Driver Implementation
Without correct minimums:
- Requests below minimum get ACK but no data
- Driver appears broken despite correct implementation
- Users assume missing hardware

With correct minimums:
- Driver automatically enforces minimums
- Requests above minimum work perfectly
- Returns only requested count (trims excess)

### Response Pattern Analysis

**Successful Read** (Above Minimum):
```
Request:  Service=0x04, Selector=0x10, Offset=0, Length=8
Response: Byte 4 = 0x08 (8 bytes payload)
          Byte 31 = 0x94 (ACK_WITH_DATA)
          Payload = [0xE2, 0x00, 0x6E, 0xF9, 0x00, 0x3E, 0x92, 0x54]
Status:   ✓ SUCCESS
```

**Failed Read** (Below Minimum):
```
Request:  Service=0x04, Selector=0x10, Offset=0, Length=4
Response: Byte 4 = 0x00 (NO payload)
          Byte 31 = 0xD4 (ACK_NO_DATA)
          Payload = (empty)
Status:   ✗ EMPTY - Below minimum!
```

**Key Observation**: PLC acknowledges (0xD4) but returns no data when below minimum length.

## Impact

**Critical**: This discovery unlocked 100% functionality. Without it, only 3 of 9 memory types would work. With it, **ALL 9 memory types with 15 access modes work perfectly!**

This was the **final breakthrough** that made the driver production-ready.

# Recommendations for Future Implementers

1. **Start with DFRWS 2017 paper** - provides excellent foundation
2. **Test with real hardware** - documentation has gaps
3. **Use Wireshark** - packet captures reveal undocumented behavior
4. **Test incrementally** - verify each discovery before moving on
5. **Document everything** - help future developers avoid these issues
6. **Ask about hardware config** - slot number, firmware version, installed modules
7. **Don't assume defaults** - verify all assumptions against actual PLC
8. **Check firmware version** - requirements may vary between models/versions
